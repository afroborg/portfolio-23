# Personal portfolio website 2023

This is a personal portfolio website for 2023. It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static site generation and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
Sprinkled in are some [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components for the interactive elements.

Thanks to [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) for the inspiration of a lot of the design.
